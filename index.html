   <p>All I know is (ooh-ooh-ooh)
    <br>We could go anywhere, we could do
    <br>Anything, girl, whatever the mood we're in
    <br>All I know is (ooh-ooh-ooh)
    <br>Getting lost late at night, under stars
    <br>Finding love standing right where we are, your lips
    <br>They pull me in the moment, you and I alone and
    <br>People may be watching, I don't mind
    <br>'Cause
    <br>Anywhere with you feels right
    <br>Anywhere with you feels like
    <br>Paris in the rain
    <br>Paris in the rain
    <br>We don't need a fancy town
    <br>Or bottles that we can't pronounce
    <br>'Cause anywhere, babe
    <br>Is like Paris in the rain
    <br>When I'm with you
    <br>When I'm with you
    <br>Paris in the rain
    <br>Paris in the rain
    <br>I look at you now and I want this forever
    <br>I might not deserve it but there's nothing better
    <br>Don't know how I ever did it all without you
    <br>My heart is about to, about to jump out of my chest
    <br>Feelings they come and they go, that they do
    <br>Feelings they come and they go, not with you
    <br>The late nights and the street lights and the people
    <br>Look at me, girl, and the whole world could stop
    <br>Anywhere with you feels right
    <br>Anywhere with you feels like
    <br>Paris in the rain
    <br>Paris in the rain
    <br>We don't need a fancy town
    <br>Or bottles that we can't pronounce
    <br>'Cause anywhere, babe
    <br>Is like Paris in the rain
    <br>When I'm with you
    <br>When I'm with you
    <br>Paris in the rain
    <br>Paris in the rain (oh)
    <br>Girl, when I'm not with you
    <br>All I do is miss you
    <br>So come and set the mood right
    <br>Underneath the moonlight
    <br>(Days in Paris, nights in Paris)
    <br>Paint you with my eyes closed
    <br>Wonder where the time goes
    <br>(Yeah, isn't it obvious, isn't it obvious?)
    <br>Come and set the mood right
    <br>Underneath the moonlight
    <br>'Cause anywhere with you feel right
    <br>Anywhere with you feels like
    <br>Paris in the rain
    <br>Paris in the rain
    <br>Walking down an empty street
    <br>Puddles underneath our feet
</p>
