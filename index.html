               <p>All I know is (ooh-ooh-ooh)
                <br>We could go anywhere, we could do
                <br>Anything, girl, whatever the mood we're in
                <br>All I know is (ooh-ooh-ooh)
                <br>Getting lost late at night, under stars
                <br>Finding love standing right where we are, your lips
                <br>They pull me in the moment, you and I alone and
                <br>People may be watching, I don't mind
                <br>'Cause
                <br>Anywhere with you feels right
                <br>Anywhere with you feels like
                <br>Paris in the rain
                <br>Paris in the rain
                <br>We don't need a fancy town
                <br>Or bottles that we can't pronounce
                <br>'Cause anywhere, babe
                <br>Is like Paris in the rain
                <br>When I'm with you
                <br>When I'm with you
                <br>Paris in the rain
                <br>Paris in the rain
                <br>I look at you now and I want this forever
                <br>I might not deserve it but there's nothing better
                <br>Don't know how I ever did it all without you
                <br>My heart is about to, about to jump out of my chest
                <br>Feelings they come and they go, that they do
                <br>Feelings they come and they go, not with you
                <br>The late nights and the street lights and the people
                <br>Look at me, girl, and the whole world could stop
                <br>Anywhere with you feels right
                <br>Anywhere with you feels like
                <br>Paris in the rain
                <br>Paris in the rain
                <br>We don't need a fancy town
                <br>Or bottles that we can't pronounce
                <br>'Cause anywhere, babe
                <br>Is like Paris in the rain
                <br>When I'm with you
                <br>When I'm with you
                <br>Paris in the rain
                <br>Paris in the rain (oh)
                <br>Girl, when I'm not with you
                <br>All I do is miss you
                <br>So come and set the mood right
                <br>Underneath the moonlight
                <br>(Days in Paris, nights in Paris)
                <br>Paint you with my eyes closed
                <br>Wonder where the time goes
                <br>(Yeah, isn't it obvious, isn't it obvious?)
                <br>Come and set the mood right
                <br>Underneath the moonlight
                <br>'Cause anywhere with you feel right
                <br>Anywhere with you feels like
                <br>Paris in the rain
                <br>Paris in the rain
                <br>Walking down an empty street
                <br>Puddles underneath our feet
            </p>
